## ESLint Configuration examples

All configurations have to be JSON formatted. If you need a module that isn't currently available you are welcome to open an issue. Likewise if you have a configuration you want to share.

- The reactStarterKit.json contains the ESLint configuration that I use on this repository. It is build on the [React Starter Kit boilerplate](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit).
