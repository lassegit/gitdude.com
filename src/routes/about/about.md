Questions, bugs and issues should be directed to the site's [Github account](https://github.com/lassegit/gitdude.com). It is still in Beta.

## What

Gitdude is a service that runs ESLint – with your custom configuration – on code commited to your Github repository. This is how you get started:

- Sign in with your Github account (in the top right corner)

- Add the Github repository you want to commit comments on

- Configure the ESLint configuration for the repository (using JSON)

- Click the "Activate" button and Gitdude will start commenting on your Github commits

Note: Gitdude do NOT commit any code to your repository, only a discreet comment on your commits on Github.

## To do

Gitdude is still very early in the process and I have – and perhaps you too – improvements ideas. You are welcome to open an issue on the [Github](https://github.com/lassegit/gitdude.com).

## Who

My name is Lasse T. and I am a danish programmer living and working in Berlin. I love building my own projects. My [Github account](https://github.com/lassegit).
